# 1.2.10 (2015-12-23)

- Get modifiers even if the field's value returned to the default value.

# 1.2.9 (2015-12-22)

- Clear unnecessary modifiers before calling the "getModified" method
- Fix bug when getting modifiers of the document with the "\_id" field but without collection

# 1.2.8 (2015-12-19)

- Improve backward compatibility with 1.2.6
- Don't get plain value when saving value of the "null" type field

# 1.2.7 (2015-12-16)

- Performance improvements

# 1.2.6 (2015-12-02)

- Fix a bug with modifiers when setting object using a reference

# 1.2.5 (2015-12-02)

- Allow Mongo ObjectId as id

# 1.2.4 (2015-11-25)

- Don't check selector validity on the client only collections

# 1.2.3 (2015-11-22)

- Return popped/pulled values from the `pop()` and `pull()` methods

# 1.2.2 (2015-11-16)

- Fix a bug disallowing multiple pull operations

# 1.2.1 (2015-11-08)

- Fix a bug on setting nested object in a nested array
- Fix a problem with setting a default value for the `_id` property
- Calling the `find()` method from the class level should only find documents being instances of a given class
- Introduce `Astro.config.disableTransform` option to disable transformation globally

# 1.2.0 (2015-10-30)

- Introduced behavior methods thanks to which you can run behavior at any moment
- Throw an error when the nested class does not exist
- Added the `type` property to the class field object to easily determine of which type a given field is (for packages/modules authors)
- Clear modifiers when pushing a nested document with modifications

# 1.1.5 (2015-10-26)

- I hope it's a last fix to the `pull()` method :). Now it solves a problem with assumption that nested field is instance of the Astronomy class

# 1.1.4 (2015-10-24)

- Fix the `pull()` method to not convert array of nested classes to array of plain objects

# 1.1.3 (2015-10-22)

- The `pull()` method looks for a values in array by value not by reference
- For the `boolean` type, the "false" or "FALSE" string will be cased to `false`

- Fixed pushing a value to an array field of a nested document without a schema

# 1.1.1 (2015-10-17)

- Allow turning off transform function per environment by setting it to `null`
- Add ability to detect existence of the given event type using the `Class.hasEvent('eventType')` function

# 1.1.0 (2015-10-11)

- [Add the "raw()" method](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#raw)
- [Change the way how the "get()" method works](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#raw) - this needs more clarification. As 1.1.0 version should be backward compatible with 1.0.0, this one change is breaking a compatibility. I know I shouldn't do so, but I had to. In most situation you won't even see any difference. From now the `raw()` method is getting responsibilites of the `get()` method
- Fix the internal `_clearModifiers()` method

# 1.0.2 (2015-10-02)

- [Add the "pull()" method](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#pull)
- Add `getMethod()`, `getBehavior()` etc. to every class
- Stop using the `initSchema` event in every module

# 1.0.1 (2015-10-01)

- Fix the `initSchema` event

# 1.0.0 (2015-09-30)

- [Changes in behaviors creation](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#writing-behaviors)
- The `supportLegacyBrowsers` configuration variable was removed. To support older browsers and simplify the Astronomy code, there was a need for abandoning some features from ES6 that can't be polyfilled. The only change is that you should always use [modification functions](http://astronomy.jagi.io/#modifying-documents) to change values of the fields. You shouldn't change them directly.

# 0.4.0 (2015-05-07)

- New events system

# 0.4.0 (2015-04-29)

- The field type definition in the form of string instead casting function.

```js
// Before.
Post = Astro.Class({
  /* ... */
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: String, // Change.
      default: ''
    }
  }
});

// After.
Post = Astro.Class({
  /* ... */
  fields: {
    title: {
      type: 'string', // Change.
      default: ''
    }
  }
});
```

```js
// Before
Post = Astro.Class({
  /* ... */
  transform: true
});

// After
Post = Astro.Class({
  /* ... */
  // Don't have to write "transform: true" anymore.
});

```
